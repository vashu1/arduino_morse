
This code can be used for turning Arduino into morse learning gadget or for adding morse functionality into existing Arduino project.


======================== Morse learning gadget

Just compile this project and upload to your Arduino.

Connect a button to DECODING_KEY_PIN and ground, and connect buzzer to ENCODING_BUZZER_PIN and ground. Everything is ready!

Play letter 'n', '-.', dash and dot to get new training word. 

Listen to it and play it back. 

If you did it right you will hear "ok", '--- -.-'. 

Otherwise the vord will be played again. 

Input 'n' again to move to the next word.


Edit arduino_morse.ino file

ENCODING_BUZZER_PIN - sets pin for playing morse code. 10 by default.
ENCODING_SPEED - sets speed of playing morse in msec per dot. 100 ms by default.
DECODING_KEY_PIN - sets pin for reading morse code. A3 by default.
DECODING_SPEED - sets speed of reading morse in msec per dot. 100 ms by default.

Use #define to setup training vocabulary.
#define _ETAIMN_- adds ETAIMN letters.
#define _O_ - adds O letter vocabulary.
#define _ALL_LETERS_ - adds everything.

Add letters in the following order - etianmosrhdlucmfywgpbvkxqjz.


======================== Adding morse functionality into existing Arduino project

You will need the following files

MorseEncoder.h  MorseEncoder.cpp  - reading morse 
MorseDecoder.h MorseDecoder.cpp   - playing morse
MorseSettings.h MorseSettings.cpp - common data, morse table

Add includes into your project

#include "MorseEncoder.h"
#include "MorseDecoder.h"

MorseEncoder *morseEncoder = new MorseEncoder(ENCODING_BUZZER_PIN, ENCODING_SPEED);
MorseDecoder *morseDecoder = new MorseDecoder(DECODING_KEY_PIN, DECODING_SPEED);

In your setup() function setup used pins

  pinMode(ENCODING_BUZZER_PIN, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(DECODING_KEY_PIN, INPUT_PULLUP);
  
Setup callbacks
 
  morseDecoder->decodedWordCallback = endTest;
  
Add into loop()

void loop() {
  morseEncoder->loopPlayMorse();
  morseDecoder->loopDecodeMorse();
}

Now every time a word is decoded, decodedWordCallback of morseDecoder will be called with decoded text as argument.

To play some morse just call

morseEncoder->playMorse("some morse");
